    <center><h2>In The Beginning...</h2></center>
     
    <p>The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the birth of the abacus.  When the beads on 
        the  abacus  are  moved  around,  according  to programming rules  memorized  by  the  user,  all  regular
        arithmetic problems can be done.  In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was
        built  in  1694.  It  could  add,  and,  after  changing  some  things  around,  multiply.    About  a  century  later
        Thomas of  Colmar  created  the  first  successful mechanical  calculator  that  could add,  subtract,  multiply, and divide. </p>

    <center><h2>Other Memorable Events...</h2></center>

    <ul><li>In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were really a series of predictable actions that were constantly repeated. 
        He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which he called a difference engine. </li>
    <br />
        <li>Herman  Hollerith  and  James  Powers  made  a  step  towards  automated  computing  with  the development of punched cards. Reading 
            errors were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size. For 
            more than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the world's first business computing.</li>
    <br />
        <li>The start of World War II produced a large need for computer capacity.  In 1942, John P. Eckert and John W. Mauchly decided to build a 
            high-speed electronic computer to do the job. Known as <a class = "links" href = "https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/eniac.htm" target = "_blank">ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)</a>, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300 per second.</li>
    <br />
        <li>Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed the image of the computer field - Magnetic  Core  Memory and Transistor - 
            Circuit  Elements.  These  technical  discoveries  quickly found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found in large computer 
            centers operated by industry, government, and private laboratories. </li>

        <li>In  the  1960's,  efforts  to  design  and  develop  the  fastest  possible  computer  with  the  greatest capacity reached a turning point with 
            the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000 words. </li>    
    <br />
        <li>Many  companies,  some  new  to  the  computer  field,  introduced  programmable mini computers supplied with software packages in the 1970’s. 
            The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small enough and inexpensive  
            enough to  be purchased  and  used  by  individuals.   Many  companies,  such as  Apple Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970’s.</li>    
    <br />
        <li>By the late 1980’s, some personal computers were run by microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time, could process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.</li>    
    <br />
        <li>Computer  networking,  e-mail, the  Internet,  and  electronic  publishing  are  just  a  few  of  the applications that have grown in recent years. Computers 
            continue to decrease in price, offering the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes, offices, and schools”. </li>

<img src = "Images/Dr-Seuss-computers.gif" alt = "If Dr. Suess Were a Technical Writer by Anonymous" id = "suess" />
<h3>Scrolling Text With Marquee Tag:</h3>  
<p> The HTML feature I decided to use is the marquee tag which is used to create scrolling text in HTML. The text can be modified to scroll horizontally left to right, 
    or right to left, or vertically from top to bottom or bottom to top. As HTML5 prioritizes semantics above presentation, the < marquee > element is considered obsolete and not 
    regarded as best practice for creating scrolling text in HTML. The recommendation is now to use CSS animations or CSS marquees. Because of backward compatibility, the 
    majority of browsers still enable scrolling text in HTML. Below is a poem called <a class = "links" href = "https://pickmeuppoetry.org/if-dr-seuss-were-a-technical-writer-by-anonymous/ " class = "links" target = "_blank">
    If Dr. Seuss Were A Technical Writer by Anonymous.</a></p>



<marquee><p style = "color:purple"> If Dr. Seuss Were A Technical Writer by Anonymous: Here’s an easy game to play. Here’s an easy thing to say. If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, 
    And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort. And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report! If your cursor finds a menu 
    item followed by a dash, And the double ­clicking icon puts your window in the trash, And your data is corrupted ’cause the index doesn’t hash. Then your situation’s hopeless and your system’s 
    gonna crash! You can’t say this? What a shame, sir! We’ll find you another game, sir! If the label on the cable on the table at your house Says the network is connected to the button on the 
    mouse, But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol, That’s repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall, And your screen is all distorted by the side affects of Gauss, So your icons 
    in the windows are as wavy as a souse, Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, ‘Cause as sure as I’m a poet, the sucker’s gonna hang! When the copy of your floppy’s getting sloppy 
    on the disk, And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC. Then you have to flash your memory and you’ll want to RAM your ROM. Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your

    <h3>CSS Animations:</h3>
   <p>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want. To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
    
    <h3>The @keyframes Rule:</h3>
    When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times. To get an animation to work, you must bind the animation to an element.</p>
